# whelm
Whelm is a minimalist CLI tool for monitoring your whelm level. This level
ranges from minimum whelm to maximum whelm.

## How To Use
Entering `whelm` returns current whelm levels. The program can also take an
argument from 0 to 4, which is used to set whelm level - for example, `whelm 0`
sets the level to "Minimum Whelm", while `whelm 4` sets it to "Maximum Whelm".
